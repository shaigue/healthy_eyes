## TODO:
- [ ] add feedback upon recording.
- [ ] draw a graph of eye strain over time, each unit is half a day.
- [ ] draw a graph of number of minutes of input recorded / day. x-axis unit is a day.
maybe based on research?
- [ ] change the way that the data is recorded such that 
only minutes where input was recorded are recorded. without 'True' and 'False' values.
- [x] add some logging for debugging.
- [x] the alert appears more than twice a day. check what is up with that.
- [x] move data files to a separate directory.
- [x] Create a more intuitive scale to eye strain levels. 
the current range from 0 to 5 does not mean so much.
